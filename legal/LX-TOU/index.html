            <div class="content">
                <h2>ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h2>
                <p>These terms, including this introductory section, create a binding legal contract between you and Netsource Interactive, Inc., and/or its affiliates (collectively, the “Company”, “we,” or “us”). By using the Company products, you agree that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these terms. If you do not accept these terms, you may not, and are not authorized to, use or access any Company products or services offered. These general terms and conditions govern the access to and/or the use of Netsource LX (the “Portal”), as well as the use and/or performance of the Portal or any services ancillary to the creation, maintenance, or provision of the Portal (collectively, the “Services”). In these terms and conditions, the terms “you”, “your”, and/or “User” shall refer to any entity, organization, or individual accessing and/or using the Portal and/or enabling a third-party to access and/or use the Portal. Your use of the Services is governed by these Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy (which together constitute the “Terms”). Services are offered to you conditioned on your acceptance without modification of these Terms. Your use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of the Terms. Please read these Terms carefully. If you are purchasing Services on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have authority to bind that entity to these Terms. There may be times when we offer add-on services that have their own terms and conditions that apply in addition to these Terms; in those cases, the terms specific to the add-on services will control to the extent that there is a conflict with these Terms. No oral modifications will be permitted. These Terms are subject to modification, and may be updated from time to time. Your continued use of the Portal and/or Services constitutes an acceptance of any modified Terms. These Terms apply in equal force to Users who obtain a Subscription (as defined below) as well as any end-users who are granted access by someone other than the Company.</p>
                <h2>FREE TRIAL</h2>
                <p>To allow you to evaluate the Services offered by the Company, you may register for a free trial, which allows you to use the Services for a limited period of time without a fee. Free trials are governed by these Terms and may be terminated by the Company at its sole discretion, with or without notice. Users are limited to one (1) free trial. If, by the end of the trial period, you do not purchase the Services, the Company may, at its sole discretion, terminate your right to access the Portal and may delete all data, information, and content uploaded by the user without any liability. The Company may extend the trial period at its discretion.</p>
                <h2>FEES AND PAYMENT</h2>
                <p>Access to the Portal requires the payment of fees. Access to the Portal (“Access”), whether it is a free trial or fee-based Access, entitles the User to a license to use the Portal in accordance with these Terms, as modified from time to time.  If you purchase Access, any such access will be subject to the fee schedule applicable on your Order Form Agreement, which will contain the terms of your subscription (the “Subscription”) and the term thereof (the “Subscription Term”). At the end of your Subscription Term, your subscription will automatically renew at the then current prices. All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies and duties and you shall be responsible for payment of such taxes. If timely payment is not received, we may disable your Access until such a payment is received. You agree to pay reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs incurred by us to collect any unpaid amounts owed by you. Until your Subscription is terminated in accordance with these Terms, you acknowledge and understand that we will continue to charge you for the Services regardless of whether the Services are used or not until you notify us to cancel your subscription. No refunds will be given. Providing your credit card billing information constitutes your express authorization to charge your credit card or debit card for the Services described herein.</p>
                <h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
                <p>How we collect, protect and use your registration data and certain other information about you are contained in our Privacy Policy, which can be found at <a href="/legal/LX-PRIVACY">Privacy Policy</a>. The Privacy Policy is part of these Terms.</p>
                <h2>YOUR RIGHTS IN YOUR WEBSITE CONTENT</h2>
                <p>You represent to us that you have all necessary rights in and to any information, data, source code and/or images (collectively, “Content”) to permit you to use the Portal without infringing the rights of others, violating any applicable laws or violating the terms of any license or agreement to which you are bound.
